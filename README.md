# The Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA)

**What is TCGA?**

The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) is a large-scale collaborative initiative aimed at understanding the molecular basis of cancer. It utilizes genome analysis technologies like large-scale genome sequencing to achieve this goal.

**Project Background:**

* Launched in 2006
* Joint collaboration between the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), both part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

**Objectives and Accomplishments:**

* Collect and analyze data from patients with various cancers.
* Conduct molecular characterization of over 33 cancer types.
* Publicly share this information as a valuable resource for the global cancer research community.
* Advance cancer diagnosis, treatment, and prevention through improved tools and strategies.
* Deepen understanding of cancer through molecular characterization.
* Identify abnormalities in gene expression, DNA sequence, epigenetics, and protein structure, revealing functional consequences.
* Significantly contribute to the field of computational biology.

**Impact on Computational Biology:**

* Generated massive datasets.
* Assembled research teams for data analysis.
* Promoted development of large-scale genomic characterization technologies.

**TCGA Resources:**

* **The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA):** A large, organized collection of medical images of cancer.
* **The Cancer Proteome Atlas Portal (TCPA):** A comprehensive data portal for accessing, visualizing, and analyzing proteomic data.
* **cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics:** Provides tools for visualizing, analyzing, and downloading large-scale cancer genomics datasets.

**Additional Analysis Tools:**

* Copy Number Portal
* DeMix
* FASMICE
* Firehose
* Firebrowse
* FunSeq2
* The Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV)
* MBatch Mutation calling using a Markov Substitution model for Evolution (MuSE)
* Regulome Explorer
* SurvNet

## Conclusion

TCGA has significantly improved our understanding of cancer at the molecular level by providing comprehensive and publicly accessible large-scale genomics data. This project has advanced cancer research, enhanced personalized medicine, and paved the way for more targeted and effective cancer treatments. The future of cancer care holds immense possibilities for improved diagnosis, prognosis, and personalized treatment approaches.
